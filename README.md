This is a project built with Next.js 15 and Chakra UI 3, focused on providing a seamless and modern web application experience.

This project showcases my ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies, creating a modern, efficient web application while staying up-to-date with the latest frameworks and tools.

- **[next-intl](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl)**: A library for internationalization (i18n) in Next.js, providing a simple and flexible way to manage translations, locale switching, and formatting for multi-language support in your application.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances development with type safety and auto-completion.
- **React Icons**: A library of popular icons for React applications, used to enrich the UI with scalable vector icons.

## Features
